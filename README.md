## Overview ##

* ZType is a typing game that takes place in a post apocalyptic world. You are a normal citizen that is running through the ruins of the old world. The goal is to type the phrases given as fast as you can to avoid the zombies and be the first to 5000 points
* Version 1.0

## How do I get set up? ##

* ZType is an Eclipse IDE project. Eclipse has version control capabilities so one can simply clone project right into eclipse. Alternatively the project can be cloned into a directory on the computer and imported into Eclipse as an existing project.
* Executable jar files will soon be stored in an out folder.
